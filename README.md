## My process

### Built with

- div
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### what-i-learned

- I learned how to center a page wrapper 'horizontally' with margin - auto.
- I learned how to center a page container 'vertically' by setting height (100vh) on the wrapper and this allows 'align-items: center' to work.
- I learned how to use the CSS layout container - flexbox

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.wrapper {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [How to host on github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT4WzyT2g8k) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
